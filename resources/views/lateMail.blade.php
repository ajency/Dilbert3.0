<p>Hey {{$firstname}}<br /><br />
We see that you logged in later than the ideal start time window.<br /><br />
Here's what the <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B17ClWYMGibaMHZiWnE4TEp3WlE">Ajency.in Handbook</a> says, "Start your day any time after 9.30 am and end by 8:30 pm. We suggest starting the day latest by 11 am. There may be days when you want to start your day late but donâ€™t make it a regular practice. For very simple reason, we work in a team. A team where each person is dependent on the other, so there has to be an overlap of at least 80% of your time. While it is okay some times, please don't make it a regular practice".<br /><br />
